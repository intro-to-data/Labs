# Labs Repository

- Year: 2020
- Semester: Winter/Spring

This repo contains labs, documentation, scripts, etc. for the ACPHS Intro To
Data course. Each week will will have a folder with the full contents of the lab
(exept for data). I will link to these resources from Canvas.

## Labs

- [Week 01](https://github.com/intro-to-data/Labs/blob/master/Week%2001/README.md)

Does this all look a little incomplete? Additional labs will be added over time.
