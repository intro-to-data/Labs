# Insurance T-Tests

This week, our data is a repeat. Our datas this week comes from Kaggle, and is 
a famous [insurance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)
frequently used to explore linear regressions.

We have used this data before, back in lab 3 and we will likely use it again
this week in class.

Using RStudio, create a new folder/project called `Insurance` OR re-use the 
project/data from Lab 3. The data hasn't changed, I promise. Download the <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-to-data/Data/master/insurance.csv"
download>insurance.csv</a> dataset and save it in the root folder of
the `Insurance` project. I will also make the data available via Canvas.

Once that is done, enjoy the [lab]()!
