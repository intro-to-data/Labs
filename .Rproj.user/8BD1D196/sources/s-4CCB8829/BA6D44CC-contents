# Week 01 - Roll The Dice

This is your first lab. This is a two-part lab. In the first part of the lab,
you will enter some data into Excel and perform some simple calculations on the
data. In the second part of the lab, you will perform the functionally
equivalent tasks in R.

The goal of this lab is two-part. I want you to get a better idea of how R and
Excel are broadly equivalent. Some things are easier in R. Some things are
easier in Excel. Excel is more visual, but combines data storage, management,
and analysis. As you will see, R separates data storage, management, and 
analysis.

This is also an oportunity to roll some dice and create some random samples 
which we will (hopefully) use later in the course to demonstrate p-hacking.

## Resources

To complete the Excel portions of this lab, you will need to know how to enter
data into Excel, and to apply formulas to small data sets. If you are not
familiar with Excel formulas, the following resources will be useful.

- [Overview of Formulas in Excel](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Overview-of-formulas-in-Excel-ecfdc708-9162-49e8-b993-c311f47ca173)
- [Calculate Average In Excel (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDjdTQt93Pc)
- Relevant Excel functions/commands:
    - Mean (Average) = `avg`
    - Sum = `sum`
- Relevant R functions/commands:
    - Mean = `mean`
    - Sum = `sum`
    - To get help on a function in R, you can prepend the function name with a
      question mark. For example `?sum` will get you the documentation for the
      `sum` function.

As with all things programming, Google is your friend. And,
[XKCD](https://www.xkcd.com/) provides us with additional explanation.

## Lab

You are welcome to use your personal laptop or the VMWare virtual desktop for
the Intro To Data course. Which-ever you use, be consistent. I also recommend
creating folder for this course with a structure for `Week 01`, `Week 02`, etc.
to manage the scripts from class, lab, etc. Don't just run everything from your
`Downloads` folder. Doing this is the path to the [dark
side](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force).

If you have any questions, please ask for help in the Canvas discussion for
labs.

### Part One

Data and code in a spreadsheet program such as Excel, LibreOffice, Google
Sheets, etc. is stored in a workbook. Within a workbook, there can be multiple
worksheets, which are similar to having multiple tabs in a browser. Because
these instructions are detailed, this looks like a lot of work. It isn't.
Assuming you know how to use a spreadsheet, this part should take you 10
minutes.

</center><br/>

1. Download the lab workbook, [here](./Roll\ The\ Dice\ (Excel).xlsx). Save this
file in your `Week 01` folder.
   - On the `Read Me` worksheet, there are some additional in-line instructions.
2. On the `Data` worksheet, fill-in the missing values for `Initials` and `Favorite Color`.
   - **Initials:** Since my name is Andy Choens, I would enter AC.
   - **Favorite Primary Color:** Should be either `Red`, `Green`, or `Blue`.
     Spelling and capitalization matter.
   - All 15 rows should have the same entries for the first two columns.

3. Use the two dice provided in class to roll 15 pairs of results. As for which
die is `Die 1` and which is `Die 2` is up to you. 
   - The only valid entries for columns `D` and `E` are integers between 1
   and 6.
4. **Row Sum:** Calculate the sum of the two dice, for each roll R01 - R15. You
can do this with a formula using either the `+` operator or `sum` function.
5. **Row Mean:** Calculate the average of each roll R01 - R15. The average of
each roll is $(Die 1 + Die 2) / 2$
6. On the `Read Me` worksheet calculate the average and sum for all rolls for
`Die 1` and `Die 2`. For example, if I rolled $1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5$,
which is absurdly unlikely, for `Die 1`, the `Die 1 Average` would be 3 and `Die
1 Sum` would be 45. If you can figure it out, you can round your answers to the
second decimal place with the `round` function.

Please note that becase of the headers, the fifteenth row of data is on the
sixteenth row of the worksheet.

Congrats. You have completed Part One of this lab. Please submit the Excel file
via Canvas.

### Part Two

We will now perform some similar calculations in R. I am generally opposed to
typing the same thing twice. But, in this case, I'm going to make an exception.
We need to put enter our dice rolls into R and perform the same calculations.
Download the [Week 01 Lab - Roll The Dice (R).R](./Week 01 Lab - Roll The Dice
(R).R) file. Place this script file in your `Week 01` folder, and open the .R file
in RStudio.

1. The .R script is contains instructions as comments. Once you have completed
the tasks in the script, please submit the completed script via Canvas.

Congrats, you have completed Part Two of the lab.
