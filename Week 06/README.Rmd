# Preamble (Andy's long ramble)

The goal of this lab is help prepare you for the mid-term. To that
end, it will focus on the types of tasks you will be asked to perform
in order to ace the mid-term. This lab may take longer than others we
have done, but I hope you will find it useful.

Before we begin, I do want to apologize for canceling this week's
class. It was, unfortunately, the best decision I could make. As of
Friday afternoon, I am still fighting an intermittent fever. This
year's flu is a nasty beast. Please take care of yourselves.

Topics which will be tested directly and links to relevant portions of our text:

- Data Import: [Data Import - R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html)
  - CSV: `read_csv()`
  - Excel: `read_excel()`
- Data Graphing (ggplot): [Data Visualisation - R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
  - Scatter plots: `geom_point()`
  - Box plot: `geom_boxplot()`
  - Bar plot: `geom_bar()`
  - Column: `geom_col()`
  - Using color and facets to compare groups.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: [EDA](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html)
- Single Table data manipulation: [Transform](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)
  - Filtering data: `filter()`
  - Ordering data: `arrange()`
  - Select columns: `select()`
  - Creating new columns: `mutate()`
  - Summary/Aggregate calculations: `summarize()`
  - Grouping: `group_by()`

Other topics, such as creating a project, writing a script, etc. will
be implicitly part of the mid-term.

This year's mid-term will not include relational data. We will discuss
relational data further during our next class, but I do not feel it is
fair to include this topic on the mid-term this year. But it will be
part of the final exam.

Before we get to the lab, I want to take some time and try to clear up
some ideas which I think are causing confusion.

## Tidyverse

What the heck is the Tidyverse? Well, it is a R meta-package! And a
meta-package is a collection of packages. All very clear now, _yes_?

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/inside_joke.png)

So what is a package? Well, that is harder to answer. A formal answer
can be taken from Hadley Wickham, who wrote most of the tidyverse
packages:

> In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A
> package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and
> is easy to share with others. As of January 2015, there were over
> 6,000 packages available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or
> CRAN, the public clearing house for R packages. This huge variety of
> packages is one of the reasons that R is so successful: the chances
> are that someone has already solved a problem that you’re working
> on, and you can benefit from their work by downloading their
> package.

-- Hadley Wickham, in [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html)

The best analogy I have ever come up with, is to compare R packages to
the Apple App Store or Google Play store for your cell phone. From the
moment you first turned it on, your phone, came with many useful tools: 

- browser,
- text app,
- email, 
- phone app (do people still use these?), 
- calendar,
-  etc. 

These are core applications (functions) a cell-phone needs in order to
be minimally useful. Can you imagine paying money for a phone that
didn't include a browser or or having to pay extra to text your Mom?

[Base R](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf)
provides many functions which are useful for statistical
programming. For example, Base R includes a set of data types, common
statistical functions for calculating aggregate statistics (`mean()`,
`sd()`), and includes functions for linear and logistic regression
modeling. These Base R functions are the programming equivalent of
having a browser and email installed on your phone by default.

Let's return to our phone analogy. Although the base apps are
important, I assume you have installed one or more apps on your phone
beyond those it came with. You may have installed a video game, or
chat application. Perhaps you are an Instagrammer, or maybe you just
use Canvas on your phone. When your phone needs additional
functionality, you install an application to make it easier for your
phone to do something.

You _could_ Instagram tonight's Ramen noodles using Safari, but it is
easier to install the Instagram app. Or, at least, that's what the
Millenials tell me.  :-)

Packages serve a similar role, for R. The tidyverse is a set of
functions which make programming in R easier. We _could_ use Base R
for this course. None of you would like it very much and I would have
to teach you even more complex programming techniques, but we _could_
do it. Just like you _can_ Instagram with Safari. But it is easier to
install the tidyverse and program in a more modern style of R. The
tidyverse is, itself, composed of a number of smaller packages such
as:

- [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)
- [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/)
- etc.

Hint: Those last two links are really useful. Did I mention the
mid-term is open-book?

If this topic interests you, here are two links worth perusing:

- [Available CRAN Packages By Name
](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html): These are all free and can be installed via `install.packages()`.
- [Welcome to the Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/paper.html): Hadley's rationale for why he wrote the Tidyverse.

## Functional Composition

Now, for a word (or two) on functional composition. A computer program
is nothing more than a list of instructions. These instructions,
called functions, allow us to embed complex logic into the program.
Some programming languages, such as SAS and SPSS have a relatively
small number of core functions, which have a large number of
parameters, sub-commands, and features. For example, the SAS `DATA
step`. Other programming languages such as R and Python have many more
commands, which each do one little thing. Either approach allows the
programmer to create very complex programs, but _how_ they do so
differs.

In a programming language such as R, we must string together a series
of related commands to accomplish complex tasks such as plotting, data
transformation, etc. The art of assembling many small commands
together to act as a cohesive unit is called functional
composition. We have encountered three forms of functional composition
in our class.

1. ggplot: `ggplot() + geom_point()`
2. dplyr: `foo %>% filter() %>% summarize()`
3. Nested functions: `foo(baz(0))`

It is important for you to understand each approach is fundamentally
doing the same thing, which is passing the results from one function
to another function. This way, you the user, can create code blocks of
arbitrary complexity, depending on your needs and programming skills,
which should grow over time. Which you should use depends on what you
are doing.

First, we will examine the ggplot approach. Each plot made with ggplot
is actually a composition of several functions. For example, a scatter
plot showing the relationship between sepal width and length in the
[iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant)) dataset looks like
this:

```{r fig.align="center"}
library(tidyverse)

## Load the data
data(iris)
iris <- as_tibble(iris)

## ggplot composition
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~Species)
```

Today, I want to re-visit what all of this code is ACTUALLY doing. We
will focus onthe ggplot composition. To produce that single plot, we
used three functions:

| Command      | Description | Operator |
|:-------------|:------------|:----------------------:|
| `ggplot()` | Creates the plotting object (our canvas), identifies the data source, assigns values to the X and Y axes, and tells plotting how to assign colors. | `+` |
| `geom_point()` | Tells plotting to create a scatter plot. | `+` |
| `facet_wrap()` | Stratifies the plot into three plots, one for each species. |  |

Alone, these functions are practically useless. For example, the
following "plot" is valid R syntax, but not very useful. Note that the
last command, `facet_wrap()` is not followed by a `+` sign, because it
terminates the functional composition.

```{r fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species))
```

And, if you run `geom_point()` by itself, the results is not
interesting at all:

```{r}
geom_point()
```

Yet, each command in the plotting composition plays a vital role in
defining our final plot. Think of each function as adding a layer to
our plot, much like a master painter adds layers of paint to their
masterpiece. No single layer is worth hanging on your wall, but
combined, they are a composition worth considering.

Now, let's compare this to a dplyr composition. What is the average
petal length by iris species? We can answer this question this with
the following composition:

```{r}
iris %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarize(AvgPetalLength = mean(Petal.Length))
```

We can see Virginica has the longest average petal length. Now, let's
break this down like we did for ggplot:

| Command      | Description | Operator |
| `iris` | Identifies the data set we want to act on. This is broadly similar to `ggplot(data = iris)`, but because we aren't drawing anything we don't need a new object, we just need to identify which object we want to act on. | `%>%` |
| `group_by()` | Identifies which column(s) to group by. In this case, `Species`. | `%>%` |
| `summarize()` | Returns the descriptive statistic. In this case, the mean petal length. |  |

Individually, these commands are not very interesting. For example, if
we just want to see our data, this works great.

```{r}
iris
```

But it does not provide us with our summary statistics. And we can add
the `group_by()`, but it doesn't actually _do_ anything interesting,
until we add a `summarize()`.

```{r}
iris %>%
    group_by(Species)
```

Now, the returns show something (mildly) they did not previously:

```{r}
# A tibble: 150 x 5
# Groups:   Species [3]
```

**IMPORTANT:** You only use the `+` operator to do functional
composition when programmig a plot. Think of it as "adding" a layer to
your plot. Do not use `+` to do functional composition for data
transformations. In a dplyr composition, it is easier to think of each
function as a member of a relay race. Each function needs to take the
baton/data, and do something (run around the track). Then, when it is
done, it hands the baton/data off to the next function. When doing
data transformations, use `%>%` for the compositional operator.

<center>

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Relay_race_baton_pass.jpg/270px-Relay_race_baton_pass.jpg)

</center>

Finally, we have nested functions. These are functions wrapped around
functions. This is actually the most traditional form of functional
composition, although we use it less frequently when programming in
the tidyverse. Let's say we want to know the average petal length,
like before, but we want to round off the average petal length to the
nearest centimeter. Our code will be ALMOST exactly like was before,
with one additional function, `round()`.

```{r}
iris %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarize(AvgPetalLength = round(mean(Petal.Length),0))
```

Our results are now rounded to the nearest centimeter. Let's break
this down. In your mind, think of this working as follows:

| Command      | Description |
| `m <- mean(Petal.Length)` | Calculates the mean petal length, and assigns the value to the variable `m`. |
| `round(m, 0)` | Round the value of m to the nearest centimeter, by the normal rules of rounding you learned in the second grade. |

But, with functional composition, we avoid the need to create the
variable `m` explicitly. Instead of creating a variable `m`, which we
don't actually want, we simply take the results of our first function
`mean()` and pass them directly to our second function, `round()`.

Another way to think about wrapped functions is that they are similar to this:

```{r}
iris %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarize(AvgPetalLength = mean(Petal.Length)) %>%
    mutate(AvgPetalLength = round(AvgPetalLength, 0))
```

This gets us the EXACT same answer as our first composition, but it
takes an additional dplyr step. This second way of doing this is
"correct", but it may be slower for very large/complex analyses.

Another perspective on nested functions. The following code is hard to
read, but you can see the results match, but the methodology

```{r}
summarize(group_by(iris, Species),
          AvgPetalLength = round(mean(Petal.Length),0))
```

I prefer to read the dplyr approach, although the code above is
functionally identical. If you think back to some of our earlier
classes, I used this language. But, at the time this as all so new and
confusing that it probably went in one ear and out the other. If you
are coming from a language like SAS or SPSS, this may seem
overwhelming. Functional composition is, however, an idea that is
found in all C-derived languages written in the last umpteen
years. Depending on the language, it may have very different syntax,
but the concept is exactly the same.

# Lab 06

And now, after all that, let's do our lab!

## Setup

01. Use RStudio to create a new project called "Mid-term
    Review". ([RStudio
    Projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#rstudio-projects))
02. We will use two data sets for this week's lab:
    - [births.csv](https://github.com/intro-to-data/Data/blob/master/births.csv) (which you have seen before)
    - [MedicaidNewbornLowBirthWeightByCounty.csv](https://github.com/intro-to-data/Data/blob/master/MedicaidNewbornLowBirthWeightByCounty.csv) (which you have not seen before)
03. To keep things relatively simple, we will open the data directly through R. Create a file called `Lab 06.R` and copy/paste the following:

```{r}
## INIT ========================================================================
library(tidyverse)



## VARS ========================================================================
births_url <- "https://github.com/intro-to-data/Data/raw/master/births.csv"
lbw_url <- "https://github.com/intro-to-data/Data/raw/master/MedicaidNewbornLowBirthWeightByCounty.csv"



## DATA ========================================================================
CountyLBW <- read_csv(lbw_url)
CountyLBW$Year <- factor(CountyLBW$Year)

## How can we import the births data into a tibble called AlbanyBirths?
## Your Code Here!

```

04. The code provided in Step 03 is incomplete. It creates a tibble
    called LBW, which contains our Low Birth Weight data. It does not
    create a tibble called AlbanyBirths, which you will later
    need. Your task is to create Albany Births.
    
    You will aso need to take advantage of he following code to clean
    up the column names to make it easier to work with.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
AlbanyBirths <- read_csv(births_url)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
## The column names for AlbanyBirths stink. This code will fix that.
## Copy/paste this code into your .R script and make sure you have run
## everything.
names(AlbanyBirths) <- c("X1", "Facility", "Insurance", "Gender", "LengthOfStay", "Admitted", "Discharged", "BirthWeight", "TotalCharges")
```

## Low Birth Weight

Low Birth Weight (LBW) ([Low Birth Weight -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight)) is defined
by World Health Organization as a birth weight of 2,499 grams (5.51
lbs) or less, regardless of gestational age. Simplistically, LBW is
caused by one of two factors (or a combination of the two).

1. Preterm birth: birth prior to 37 weeks of gestational age
2. Small for gestational age: below average prenatal growth

Of course, the causes for these two problems are many. As we will see
later in this lab, LBW babies tend to cost more than other babies.

The `CountyLBW` dataset you have opened is a modified version of the
Health Data New York [Medicaid Newborn Low Birth Weight Rates by
County](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Medicaid-Inpatient-Prevention-Quality-Indicator-PQ/aapx-etcg). It
contains data for CY 2012 and 2013. Unfortunately, more recent data is
not available. It contains the following columns:

- `Year`: The year of the hospital discharge for the newborn. (either
  2012 or 2013)
- `County`: The newborn’s county of residence at time of
  discharge. Hospital discharges that did not have an accurate New
  York State county were excluded.
- `Burrough`: The newborn's burough or residence. Only relevant for
  children born in New York City. For all other newborns, this columns
  is `NA`.
- `Region`: The newborn's region of residence. [Regions of New York
  (state) -
  Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Regions_of_New_York_(state))
- `Upstate`: The newborn was born in Upstate New York (TRUE) or not (FALSE)
- `LowBirthWeightNewborns`: Total number of Medicaid low birth weight
  newborn discharges in a county population that meet the criteria for
  low birth weight.
- `NewbornPopulation`: Total number of newborn Medicaid enrollees in a
  county population.
  
It is very important you remember that the grain of the CountyLBW data
set is Medicaid Births _per county_. However, the data contains enough
information for us to create new data sets at higher aggregated
grains. For example, we will examine births per region, but we cannot
examine births per zip code.

### Analysis

As always, put your code into your .R file and upload it at the end of
the lab. For each task I have given you a code stub to start from. It
is your job to finish it. Very few, if any, of the code stubs actually
work as shown below.

01. Create a scatter plot showing the number of Medicaid births per
    year for each county. From 2012 to 2013, did the number of births
    go up or down? To help you, try adding `group = County` to your
    aesthetic mapping (`aes()`) and after your `geom_point()`, add a
    `geom_line()`. If your code has two vertical lines, look at your
    aesthetic mapping.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 01: Scatter plot of the number of Medicaid newborns

ggplot() +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(CountyLBW, aes(factor(Year), NewbornPopulation, group = County)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line()
```

02. Create a statewide summary of Medicaid births in New York for 2012
    and 2013. This will be similar to the `iris` example above, but
    you have to decide which column to group by. The summary function
    you want to use here is `sum()` rather than `mean()` since we want
    the total number of births statewide, not the average. (Average
    births per county statewide doesn't even mean anything.)

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 02: Statewide summary of Medicaid births

CountyLBW %>%
    group_by() %>%
    summarize()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
CountyLBW %>%
    group_by(Year) %>%
    summarize(Births = sum(NewbornPopulation))

## The best answer is that over-all, the statewide medicaid births
## declined from 2012 to 2013, but that most counties were flat, with
## only a few driving the decrease.
```

How would you describe change in the number of Medicaid births statewide?

- Increasing births.
- Decreasing births.
- Some counties increasing, some decreasing.
- Really hard to say.

Please support your answer. Enter your answer into canvas. There isn't
one single best answer.

03. The filter function allows us to perform Boolean tests to reduce
    the number of rows used in the analysis. This is very useful.
    https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html
    
    Use the filter command to calculate the total number of Medicaid
    births in 2012 and 2013 _in the Finger Lakes region_ of New York
    State. Remember, Boolean tests in R use `==` not `=`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 03: Total number of Medicaid births in 2012-2013 in the Finger Lakes

CountyLBW %>%
    filter()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
CountyLBW %>%
    filter(Region == "Finger Lakes") %>%
    summarize(Births = sum(NewbornPopulation))
```

Enter this count into Canvas.

04. Using your previous code as a starting point, calculate the total
    number of Medicaid births _in 2012 (only)_ in the Finger Lakes
    region. You almost certainly know how to do this with a
    `group_by()`, but in this case, I want you to only use
    `filter()`. You can use a `,` or the `&` symbol to "and" filters.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 04: Total number of Medicaid births in 2012 in the Finger Lakes

CountyLBW %>%
    filter()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
CountyLBW %>%
    filter(Region == "Finger Lakes", Year == 2012) %>%
    summarize(Births = sum(NewbornPopulation))
```

Enter this count into canvas.

05. Which region had the most Medicaid births in 2013? To calculate
    this, you should first filter down to 2013 returns only, and then
    group by region. You know how to find the totals. PLEASE note that
    this changes the grain of the data. The grain of the data becomes
    Medicaid births per region, which is an aggregated set of
    counties.
    
    As an analyst, you always want the finest grain of data
    possibe. With enough effort, you can always aggregate data into a
    higher grain. But you cannot disaggregate below what you were
    given/collected. You cannot use this data to tell me anything
    about Medicaid birth in the city of Albany, because the city is a
    subset of the Albany county data. And you cannot know which births
    happened in the city of Albany and which happened in the county.
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 05: Which region had the most Medicaid births in 2013?

CountyLBW %>%
    foo()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
CountyLBW %>%
    filter(Year == 2013) %>%
    group_by(Region) %>%
    summarize(Births = sum(NewbornPopulation))
```

Please select the region with the most Medicaid births in
Canvas. Also, this answer should **not** surprise you. If you think
the right answer is the North Country region, you are wrong.

06. Calculating a rate is a very important skill. Our data set
    includes data about LBW Medicaid births. What is the Statewide
    rate of LBW births per 1,000 Medicaid births?
    
    I know, I know, the head boggles. But if you break this down, you
    know how to do this. This rate will include both 2012 AND 2013
    data, so no filtering is required. Instead, you must first
    calculate the total newborn population and low birth weight
    newborns for these two years. 
    
    Your answer should pipe (`%>%`) the results of `summarize()` to
    `mutate()`. The `mutate()` function will create a column `Rate`
    which is the rate of low birth weight births per 1,000 Medicaid
    births.
        
    Hint: To convert a rate to a percent, you multiple it by 100. This
    converts the rate into `N` per 100. But this task wants a `N` per
    1,000.
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 06: What is the Statewide rate of LBW births per 1,000 Medicaid births?
## Yes, this is possible.
CountyLBW %>%
    summarize() %>%
    mutate()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
CountyLBW %>%
    summarize(N = sum(LowBirthWeightNewborns),
              D = sum(NewbornPopulation)) %>%
    mutate(Rate = N/D*1000)
```

07. Which region had the highest LBW rate per 1,000 Medicaid births?

    This is a minor tweak on the code you wrote for task 06. You will
    use `goup_by()` to complete this task. There are 10 regions in the
    State. R will, by default, order the regions in alphabetical
    order. I suggest you force R to order the results by the `Rate`
    column using `arrange()`. Otherwise, you might not see the true
    answer.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 07: Which region has the highest rate of LBW births per 1,000 Medicaid births?
CountyLBW %>%
    arrange()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
CountyLBW %>%
    group_by(Region) %>%
    summarize(N = sum(LowBirthWeightNewborns),
              D = sum(NewbornPopulation)) %>%
    mutate(Rate = N/D*1000) %>%
    arrange(desc(Rate))
```

Take a moment to look at your per-region `Rate` calculations. Look at
the spread of those numbers. 

- Highest: 86 LBW births per 1,000 Medicaid births
- Lowest: 55 LBW births per 1,000 Medicaid births

Take a moment to think about the geographic, demographic, and economic
differences across these regions. Some of the causes of LBW in
Manhattan differ from those in the North Country. Some are the same. A
successful intervention in The Bronx will look nothing like a
successful intervention in Western New York.

Data is powerful, but it often creates as many questions as it
answers.

## Albany Births

We used this data previously when we were first starting to
graph. Before going any further, remember that the LBW birth rate per
1,000 Medicaid births for the Capital District was 67.2. Let's see how
that compares to this data set.

08. Which births meet the criteria for Low Birth Weight? 

    Create a new column called LBW. This should be a TRUE/FALSE
    column. For each birth in AlbanyBirths, determine if the birth
    qualifies as a LBW. In other words, is the birth `weight <= 2499`?
    This is another problem for `mutate()`. However, this time we want
    to save our results back to AlbanyBirths so we can use the column
    in future calculations.
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 08: Which births meet the criteria for Low Birth Weight? 

## SEE HOW THIS CREATES A NEW AlbanyBirths dataset.
AlbanyBirths <- AlbanyBirths %>%
    mutate()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
AlbanyBirths <- AlbanyBirths %>%
    mutate(LBW = BirthWeight <= 2499)
```

09. Which insurance company has the highest total number of LBW
    births?

    Create a barplot of the total number of low birth weight births,
    stratified by Insurance.

    Hint: You will need to filter the data going into ggplot because
    you only want to count those rows where `LBW == TRUE`. To do this,
    you have two choice. You can create a new data set (like we did
    above), or apply a filter in the data parameter in `ggplot(data =
    AlbanyBirths %>% filter(), aes())`. You can achieve the same
    results either way.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 09: Which insurance company has the highest total number of LBW births?
ggplot() +
    geom_col()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = AlbanyBirths %>% filter(LBW == TRUE), aes(x = Insurance)) +
    geom_col()
```

10. Is the average birth cost of LBW births higher than non-LBW births?

    This is your last data transformation task. Break this task
    down. If you made it this far, you can do this. Think about the
    individual data transformations you will need to make to complete
    this task

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 10: Is the average birth cost of LBW births higher than non-LBW births?


```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
AlbanyBirths %>% group_by(LBW) %>% summarize(M = mean(TotalCharges))
```

In Canvase, answer two questions:
- Is the average birth cost of LBW births higher than non-LBW births? (No, Yes)
- What is the average cost of a LBW birth in the Capital District?

11. Which plot is better?

    This is your last task. Let's look at some linear regressions of
    birth weight and cost. Create a scatter plot. On the X Axis, put
    `BirthWeight`. On the Y Axis, put `TotalCharges`.
    
    Then, create a second copy of the plot (copy/paste your code). In
    the aesthetic add, `group = "LBW", color = "LBW"`.
    
    Create a thid plot, copy/paste the code for your first plot. Do
    not use the code for your second plot. Add a `facet_wrap()` to the
    end of plot composition. Wrap by `LBW`.
    
    [`geom_smooth()`
    documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html)
    We are using `method = lm`, to get a linear regression, rather
    than the default loess model. I don't really like the loess
    model. IF you 'd like to see the difference, delete the `method =
    lm` part of the code. Perhaps you will think this improves the
    model. I dunno. You tell me.
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 11: Which plot is better?

## First Plot
ggplot() +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm)

## Second Plot
ggplot() +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm)

## Third Plot
ggplot() +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm)

## Which plot is better?
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## First Plot
ggplot(AlbanyBirths, aes(BirthWeight, TotalCharges)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm)

## Second Plot
ggplot(AlbanyBirths, aes(BirthWeight, TotalCharges, group = LBW, color = LBW)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm)

## Third Plot
ggplot(AlbanyBirths, aes(BirthWeight, TotalCharges)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm) +
    facet_wrap(~LBW)

## I personally prefer the second plot. I think it tells the story the best.

Go to Canvas and upload your favorite plot and then tell me why you
prefer it.  For help exporting the plot from RStudio:
